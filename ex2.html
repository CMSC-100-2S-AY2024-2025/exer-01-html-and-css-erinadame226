                <h3>Elbi Express</h3>
                <p>Elbi Express is a two-player delivery game built using Java, where players choose a vehicle (truck, car, or motorcycle) 
                    and race against time to deliver goods from merchants to households. The goal is to deliver all items within 5 minutes 
                    while maintaining a community happiness level. Players must navigate natural disasters, complete mini-tasks, and work 
                    together to succeed before time runs out.</p>

                <h3>Diet Problem Solver</h3>
                <p>The Diet Problem Solver is a linear programming-based application that determines the most cost-effective and nutritious 
                    combination of food items to meet an individual's daily nutritional needs. The program minimizes the total cost while 
                    ensuring the diet adheres to constraints on calories, fat, sodium, vitamins, and other essential nutrients. Users can 
                    select from a list of available food items and specify serving sizes, after which the system computes the optimal solution, 
                    displaying the food items, servings, and total cost in a user-friendly table.</p>

                <h3>Type Pattern Game</h3>
                <p>The "Type the Pattern" game challenges players to memorize and accurately reproduce a randomly generated pattern of characters 
                    within a given time limit. As the difficulty increases, the patterns grow longer, and the characters can include lowercase 
                    letters, numbers, and symbols. The game tracks the player’s score, rewarding correct guesses with an increasing challenge. 
                    A high score leaderboard is maintained, saving the player’s name, score, and the last pattern they successfully typed. 
                    The game ensures a fun and progressively difficult experience with options for various difficulty levels and a scoring 
                    system.</p>
